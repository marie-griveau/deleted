  	  <h3 id="About Artemis">Artemis</h3>
      <p>Artemis, in Greek mythology, is the goddess of the hunt, moon, wilderness, childbirth, maidenhood and chastity. She is the daughter of Zeus and Leto and the twin sister of Apollo. Artemis is often depicted as a youthful and athletic figure, carrying a bow and arrow and accompanied by hunting dogs or deer. Additionally, she is always accompanied by her nymphs. She is known for her love of hunting, and for punishing harshly those who anger her.</p>

      <p>Artemis is one of the three major virgin goddesses, along Hestia and Athena. She is fiercely protective of her chastity, leaving no mercy for those who seek to compromise her. She is a patron and protector of young girls, while also being a patron of healing and disease affecting women and children.</p>

      <p>She plays a significant role in various myths and legends. One of the most famous stories involving her is the tale of Actaeon, a hunter who accidentally sees Artemis bathing naked. He is turned into a stag as punishment and killed by his 50 hounds. In the myth featuring Niobe, Niobe claimed to be superior to Artemis' mother Leto. Enraged, Leto ordered her children, Apollo and Artemis, to kill Niobe's children. Artemis killed her six daughters, and Apollo her six sons. Weeping, Niobe was turned into a rock.</p>

   <h3 id="About Hestia">Hestia</h3>
      <p>Hestia is the goddess of the hearth and the home. In fact, her very name means "hearth". It is her primary symbol, as the hearth's flame symbolises the home. She is the firstborn child of titans Cronus and Rhea, and one of the twelve Olympians. Hestia is depicted as a modestly-dressed and veiled woman, often holding a flower branch. She is portrayed as a calm, nurturing and loving figure.</p>

      <p>Hestia is one of the three major virgin goddesses, along Artemis and Athena. Apollo and Poseidon both asked for her hand in marriage at one point, but Hestia refused and swore an oath of chastity.</p>

      <p>Unlike her other Olympian counterparts, she does not play much of a role in myths. She remains a symbol of harmony within the home, highly respected by the ancient Greeks.</p>

   <h3 id="About Hera">Hera</h3>
      <p>Hera is the goddess of marriage, women, and childbirth. She is the daughter of Titans Cronus and Rhea, and one of the twelve Olympians. She is the Queen of the Gods as Zeus' wife. Zeus is also her brother. She had several children with him, such as Ares, god of war, Hephaestus, god of fire, and Hebe, goddess of youth. Hera is depicted as a dignified, matronly figure, upright or enthroned. She is believed to be beautiful, elegantly dressed and bejewelled, wearing a crown called Polos or a diadem. Additionally, she is sometimes veiled as a married woman.</p>

      <p>Hera is painted as an intensely jealous figure due to her husband's numerous extramarital affairs. Despite his infedelity, Hera remained faithful to him. For this reason, she is often vengeful and ruthless. However, she is also shown to be caring, helping women in need during pregnancy, labor or when their husbands abused them.</p>

      <p>The numerous myths featuring her usually entail her punishments to the women Zeus cheated with. For example, Hera turned Callisto into a bear. She punished Io by turning her into a cow and tying her on an olive tree. Additionally, she sent a dragon to pursue Leto while pregnant with Zeus' children, Apollo and Artemis. In a more famous myth, the Trojan war, Paris, the Trojan prince, was left to choose who was the rightful owner of the golden apple, aimed at "the fairest of them all". Aphrodite won his favor by promising him the fairest woman of all, and Hera became enraged. By seducing Zeus and driving Ares off the battlefield, she indirectly ensured the Greeks' triumph.</p>

   <h3 id="About Aphrodite">Aphrodite</h3>
      <p>Aphrodite is the goddess of love, beauty, passion, lust, pleasure and fertility. The origin of her birth varies, in the Iliad, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione. According to Hesiod, Cronus severed Uranus' genitals and threw them to the sea. The foam that emerged gave rise to Aphrodite, hence the meaning of her name "foam-arisen". She is depicted as a very attractive young woman, a symbol of feminine beauty, and often portrayed nude. When dressed, she is always dressed and bejewelled elegantly. She is often accompanied by her son, Eros, god of lust and sexual desire, as well as the three Charites, known as the three graces.</p>

      <p>Aphrodite is described as self-absorbed and vain, believing herself to be the most beautiful woman. She is also cunning, often lying to deceive others. In a more flattering light, she is known to be extroverted, joyful, charming and protective. She was cruel to those who did not worship her, but kind to those who did. Married to Hephaestus, god of artisans, she was often disloyal to him, engaging in many affairs. Once Hephaestus learned of a particular affair between his wife and Ares, god of war, he prepared an invisible net to catch them both in the act, in front of other gods. Hephaestus was paid by some of them to release Ares. Other lovers include Hermes, Dionysus, Poseidon, amongst many more.</p>

      <p>She plays a crucial role in numerous myths. In a very well-known one, Psyche is an extremely beautiful woman, so people started worshipping her instead of Aphrodite. Enraged, Aphrodite sent Eros to punish her, but he fell in love with her. She betrayed him by seeing his real appearance, and sought Aphrodite's help to win him back over. She forced her into impossible tasks, but managed to succeed anyways. She was then reunited with Eros and turned immortal. In certain myths, she was known for her help. In another myth, Atalanta was determined to stay unmarried until a man could outrun her, which was nearly impossible. Hippomenes, deeply in love with her, received Aphrodite's assistance, giving him three golden apples from the gardens of Hesperides. During the race, he would drop the apples at convenient times to successfully distract Atalanta. Thanks to Aphrodite, he won the race and married her.</p>

   <h3 id="About Demeter">Demeter</h3>
      <p>Demeter is the goddess of harvest, agriculture, and fertility. She is the daughter of Cronus and Rhea, and one of the twelve Olympians. She is depicted as a mature, maternal, resilient and generous woman. Demeter is said to be beautiful, sometimes veiled or crowned, often holding wheat, cornucopia, or a torch.</p>

      <p>Demeter is said to have taught mortals how to farm. She had several children, the most famous being Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld, fathered by Zeus. Demeter grew fond of a mortal man named Iasion, and lured him away from the marriage of Cadmus and Harmonia. After the act, Zeus guessed what had happened and, out of jealousy, killed Iasion with a thunderbolt.</p>

      <p>The most well-known myth she plays a role in, is in the abduction of Persephone. When Demeter learned her beloved daughter was abducted by Hades, she searched for her desperately, with the help of Hekate and Helios. However, upon learning that Zeus played a role in it, she became furious and mourned the loss of her daughter. She vowed not to allow crops to grow and leave mortals to starve. Desperate, Zeus demanded that Hades give Persephone back. However, as she ate a promegranate given by Hades, each seed she ate she would have to stay a month with Hades. In autumn and winter, crops die, because Persephone is in the underworld, while in spring and summer, crops are plentiful, meaning the reunion of Persephone and her mother. </p>

   <h3 id="About Athena">Athena</h3>
      <p>Athena is the goddess of wisdom, warfare, and handicraft. Her name is associated with the city of Athens. Her father is undoubtedly Zeus, and might have fathered her alone. In another story, Metis is her mother, but Zeus swallowed her as she might have had a child more powerful than him. Suffering from headaches, Hephaestus cracked Zeus' head open and Athena was born, fully grown and armored. Also described as beautiful, Athena's expression is always solemn and stern.  She usually wears either a long chiton and holds a spindle, or wears full armor, including helmet, spear and shield.</p>

      <p>She is one of the three virgin goddesses, alongside Artemis and Hestia. She is described as wise, rational, strategic and merciless, unafraid to punish those who contravene the gods and law. She is also creative and skilled, excellent in her craftsmanship. As patroness of all artisans, she shared her practical knowledge with mortals frequently. She was vain about her own weaving abilities, and had a weaving contest with the mortal Arachne, a highly-skilled weaver. Athena lost, and, enraged at her flawless execution and its depiction of drunk gods, turned Arachne into a forever-weaving spider.</p>

      <p>Athena is frequently present in Greek myths, especially those concerning conflict. During the Trojan war, she sided with the Greeks, helping Achilles and Diomedes on the battlefield. She also harmed Ares and Aphrodite for their support of the Trojans, and threatens the same fate to other gods. The infamous Trojan horse, which defined the result of the war, was her idea. Odysseus led this strategy under the goddess' protection. Another well-known myth is that of Medusa. Medusa was a beautiful young maiden, and learned of Poseidon's intentions to force himself on her. She escaped to Athena's temple, but he caught up to her. Athena punished Medusa for breaking her oath of chastity, turned her hair into snakes, and any man she looked upon would turn to stone.</p>
